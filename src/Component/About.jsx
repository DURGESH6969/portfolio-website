        When I'm not immersed in the world of development, you'll often find me exploring new avenues such as DevOps and 3D rendering, eager to delve deeper into their possibilities and streamline development processes. During my downtime, I channel my creativity into editing videos and photos, transforming moments into captivating visual stories. And yes, I must admit, I'm a big fan of cats! ðŸ˜¸
